# DogBreedClassificationModel
* In this model we will able to predict the breed of the dog given it a dog image.
* We have used deeplearning for model to predict the breed of dogs
* We have used Tensorflow 2.0 and TensorFlowHub develop the model
* the data is presented in form of images 
* we have used the data from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets
